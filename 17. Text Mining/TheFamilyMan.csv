"I believe i am the first person to complete the entire series and i am pretty sure i am in no position to go to the office right now. One thing about which i am very confident about is - Its one of the best Indian TV series so far. Amazing acting, Amazing direction, Super Amazing cinematography and what not.It was worth watching in a single go. I was completely engaged in the storyline. I would personally recommend it. Its totally different and its very much unpredictable.Good Job Team /\"

"Jack Ryan, which also happens to be an Amazon original used to be my favourite action/drama series until I saw this masterpiece. This series is very realistic and an exciting take on spy based series where the spy drives some old messed up hatchback and not an Aston Martin. The series also shows how the underpaid job of a spy affects Sri and his family. 10/10 would recommend. Doesn't matter which country you're from"

"Changing scenario in Indian storytelling and combining it with visuals is the product called THE FAMILY MAN.
What a gripping story, initially I thought same old spy story but man i was wrong, this story is as real as it gets in the real world. Wonderful cast well directed and acting credit goes to all especially Manoj Bajpayee stole the show.
Hope this is not a one or two seasons kind a thing this should get at least 4 to 5 seasons...
Totally enjoyed and every one should watch it."

"I started watching this series only for Manoj Bajpayee and he is the only worthy face in it. To be honest, the first 3 episodes are very nice but after that it traces a cliched line of a clerk-like pratagonist doing James Bond level stuff so much as going undercover to Pak helping US capture a Top US Wanted terrorist. I mean, Come on !!Important : Every episode ends with a tagline ""inspired by news headlines"" and i feel the headlines have been chosen by the makers as per their own political leanings as the series felt politically motivated where dreaded terrorists are humanised as victims who chose the path to terror due to losing family members in 2002 Riots or by Army in kashmir. While NIA, Army and police as brutal as institutional oppressors with some exceptions. Cow violence, though a grave matter, are heavily exaggerated as the official policy of the government cause of radicalisation among muslim youth whreas in actual there has not been a single instance of such radicalisation (remember the series claims to be inspired from real events). This is demonising the muslims as well as ""Revenge seekers"" who kill innocent 'kaafirs' (word used multiple times in the series).Army has been shown as oppressor in kashmir who 'rule' and brutalize innocent civilians without the nuances of the actual happenings and violence from both the sides. Cross border terrorism has also been shown to be done by some non-state actors while the Pak govt tries to help India by stopping them, which again is a lie.The above can be clubbed under 'artistic freedom' but not when the makers claim to have been ""inspired by news headlines""All in all, a series that could have been much much better if not for cliched ""Gas/nuclear attack"" being planned by the antagonists and an Uncle type 'Field Agent' who at one time sits like a clerk in a cubicle and next moment is fighting terrorists in Kashmir and Balochistan.5 Stars for cinematography, Camera work, and some never seen before scenes from Kashmir, occassional wit and humour and of course Manoj Bajpayee."
"I started this series with high hopes... but slowly it came to me that everything was cliché, characters dont seem genuine, story is not believable, scene which happen for the sake of story are simply impossible in real world,
this may have a lot do to with the fact that recently i saw ""the spy"" on netflix.. but here hardly there was a moment when I felt like ..omg this is awesome..typical bollywood cliches are present here, every terrorist is an Avenger here... trying to avenge something.. has a very good backstory, he is a son of poor headmaster, pakistan is a responsible nation. event isi is responsible..its just some Mavericks who are causing trouble... and meanwhile... indians are lynching out of passion...such inhumane country india is.. not to forget... india is a country where govt doesn't deposits 15 lakh in people's account... yes....it went that far.."

"So, a Terrorist Dropbox and a suspected Terrorist is on a 24X7 surveillance, but, two ISIS terrorists, admitted side by side are not even guarded 24X7 by the NSG or the ATS? One of them is having sex for crying out loud.
The scene in which those 3 guys got killed for trying to feed beef. One of them STARTED SHOOTING on the squad, so, how is it not an act of Terrorism? They only mentioned it once and then completely forgot about it. They said the guy never picked up arms, but, he wrote articles of provocation against the nation (not against the government).Also, this whole series is a campaign by islamic apologists. They became Terrorists because their loved ones got killed? Really? By that logic Ghori or Ghazni might've been attacked by the Hindu kings of that time and they wanted revenge. I guess Terrorism didn't existed before 1990. By that logic, Kashmiri hindus should've picked up arms and killed every muslim in sight. 30 years have passed and not even a single act of aggression has been done by them. Their slaughters are roaming freely and enjoying the government's aid while they live in refugee camps.Giving it 2 stars because the cast did a great job and Manoj Bajpai was as usual amazing."
"The storyline has nothing that we have not seen before. The context is hugely one-sided... its not even a spy thriller either. Manoj Bajpai is the only saving grace. The ending is even more dissapointing. At times, thought of quitting but carried on till the end to check if the narrative would lift itself from the biased presentation of the fight against terror. Alas none at all..."
"One of the best show by amazon .Watched it in one shot.Probably more entertaining than sacred games.You dont want avoid any episode when you start watching it.Addictive,entertaining.Best direction and screenplay.Must watch you wont regret."

"I loved Manoj Bajpai in the first 2-3 episodes that I watched. But the politically correct narrative was too much for me. The whole narrative is that TERRORISTS ARE VICTIMS. Many people liked this series, and that is understandable since it is not bad per se. But trying to pass off that someone became a terrorist because he was asked to stand up for the National Anthem during a movie just upset me off."
"What a shame. The mockery these show makers have made of NIA, RAW, police force, Indian Commandos and just security forces in general is so infuriating. It's like spitting on every Indians face.
Every terrorist activity has been justified, be it Mussa's tragedy from 02 riots or scooter bombers from J&k security force brutality.
I really wanted to like this show due to Bajpayees acting and all but sorry. It's almost justifies terrorism by saying gau rakshaks, security forces are responsible for all that's happening and people who have lifted weapons is because they were forced. Stop this non-sense once in for all.
And don't even get me started on the plot-
For god sake, it's the people who have sacrifice their everyday life (NIA, RAW, Police) show some decency and respect. No one is that stupid. Just watch yourself and judge it."

"What do i say!! This is engaging, entertainig and thrilling. Binge watched it and just now finished with it.
Manoj Bajpayee is the one to watch out for in this series. He is the perfect casting for the role of Shrikant..
Every other actor has done his/ her role perfectly.
Go, watch it guys. You are going to love it."

"The series touches many aspects of the current hot topics in the media and does a decent job in keeping the audience engaged largely due to the exceptional performance by Manoj Bajpayee.But the stink of leftist narrative is all too easy to see.1. Portrays a separation between mainstream leadership and so called non- state actors of Pakistan. Giving a virtual clean certificate to the state
2. Justifies terrorism on grounds of real and perceived atrocities on a certain community. With particular reference to 2002. In this country every religion, every region, every language group, every caste, every community has some sob story of injustice. How many of them have picked up guns? Case in point Kashmiri Pandits, one of the most brutalised community in this country, still perishing in relief camps, how many of them are blowing up people?
3. Kashmir was never a fight about political freedom and whatever legitimate demands they had is now drowned under the Islamist Tsunami to establish a Sharia state.
4. Rapping the over enthusiastic gau-rakhshaks is absolutely correct and should be condemned for the violence they have inflicted. But why no reasoning for this behaviour, shouldn't people stand up against the cow smugglers. Who are no less in inflicting violence? This is as much religious as an economic issueNet net this series is no different from the ideology of sacred games, leila and ghoul.If you are touching serious topics then show the guts and intent to go all the way, it's easy to put the blame on the majority because u know for all the noise they make in social media, they are highly unlikely to actually put a gun on your head. Play safe. Right ?:):)Good news is that most folks (at least in this country) who watch web series, usually know the truth all too well, so doesn't really matter."
